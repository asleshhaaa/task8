Task 8

VPN Setup and Browser Security Analysis Report

Introduction:
As part of this task, I explored how a VPN works, how it protects privacy, and how it affects internet performance. I also reviewed my browser extensions to ensure there were no suspicious add-ons installed.
The objective of this task was to gain hands-on experience with VPN tools and understand their role in online privacy and security.

VPN Used:
I used ProtonVPN (Free Tier) for this task.

Steps Performed:

VPN Installation
Signed up for a free ProtonVPN account.
Downloaded and installed the VPN client.
Logged into the application successfully.

Connecting to VPN
Connected to the nearest available free server.
The status showed “Connected”, confirming the VPN tunnel was active.

IP Address Verification
Checked my original IP address before connecting to VPN.
After connecting, I refreshed the IP-check website.
The IP address changed successfully, confirming that my traffic was being routed through the VPN server.

Speed Comparison Test
To observe performance impact:
Without VPN: Website loaded in 5 seconds
With VPN: Website loaded in 7 seconds

Observation:
There was a 2-second delay when using the VPN.
This slight slowdown is expected because:
Data is encrypted before transmission.
Traffic is routed through a remote VPN server.
Additional security layers increase processing time.

Browsing Test
I browsed multiple websites while connected to the VPN.
All websites loaded correctly, confirming:
The VPN connection was stable.
Internet traffic was encrypted and functional.

Browser Extension Check
I had already reviewed my browser extensions the previous day.
Currently, I only have a few trusted and necessary extensions installed.

Findings:
No unknown or suspicious extensions found.
No extensions requesting excessive or unnecessary permissions.
All installed extensions are from trusted sources.
Therefore, no extensions needed to be removed.
